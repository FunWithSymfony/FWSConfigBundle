FWSConfigBundle
===============

The FWSConfigBundle adds support for a database persisted configuration. It provides a useful interface for managing configuration in your Symfony project. This is super useful for runtime configuration management vs. using the parameters.yml file. Configuration can be organized as a flat tree or in categories.

Features include:

- Simple interface for managing configuration
- Twig extensions for accessing configuration from templates
- Unit tested
